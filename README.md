## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Intelligent Context Analysis:** Unlike basic keyword search, AI Navigator understands *intent*. (e.g., "Help me fix a bug in my Python code" -> Suggests GitHub Copilot, not just "Code").
* **⚡ Powered by Gemini Flash:** Utilizes the latest high-speed model from Google DeepMind for instant recommendations.
* **🎨 Cyber-Minimalist Design:** Features a modern "Glassmorphism" UI with a deep charcoal theme and breathing animations.
* **🔒 Privacy-First Architecture:** No backend server. Your API Key is stored securely in your browser's `localStorage` and sent directly to Google. It never touches our servers.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5 (Semantic), CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
* **AI Integration:** Google Generative AI SDK (REST API via Fetch).
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (Client-Side Rendering).
* **Styling:** Custom CSS (No frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind used for maximum performance).
